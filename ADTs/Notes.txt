NOTES

General:
	- Javascript needs to be properly pulled out of global scope (I think I already did this for Map Pins Map).
	- I still don't have a full understanding of how Liferay works so I am probably doing some Wrong Things (besides the ones I am probably doing anyway).
	- Style elements should not be in the body of an html document (nore should they be in a vtl IMO).  This is currently the only way I know of that we have to add style rules to the system.
		- This is how our vendor has been doing it, which is strange because they are able to add style rules to the system...
		- Perhaps add some javascript to the template to add the style element to the head.  
		  Does not fix that style rules should probably not be in a vtl, and the javascript code would have to be duplicated in all ADTs
	- Macros: if a macro is changed, you must change its name because of bizarre caching behavior with our liferay stack (not sure where it's happening)
	  Also, macros don't know if we can rely on that caching behavior when using other ADTs.  I feel like I tested this and it didn't work, but I will have to test again.

Event Map:
	Work in progress.  Based on Theology on Tap and Map Pins Map ADTs, so there is still some extraneous code, needs general cleanup
	
more to come...
